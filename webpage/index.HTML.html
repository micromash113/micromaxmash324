                documents. The markup 
                language used for
                preparing these web
                pages is called HTML
                In ancient days, symbols
                were used to give
                instructions to the 
                typesetter to set the type
                for printing. The size of
                letters, colours to be
                used, slant of letters, etc.
                for the text to be printed
                were represented using
                symbols or codes called
                markups. Since HTML
                language is marking up
                the content, it is called
                markup language. The
                fifth authorised edition
                of HTML is HTML 5.</h2>
             
              <h2> The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard <br>markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br> It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets<br> (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.<br>

                Web browsers receive HTML documents from a <br>web server or from local storage and render the documents into<br> multimedia web pages. HTML describes <br>the structure of a web page semantically and originally <br>included cues for the appearance of the document.
                
                HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.<br> With HTML constructs, images and other objects<br> such as interactive forms may be embedded into the<br> rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured <br>documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

                  <h2>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE,<b> a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents.<b> In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.<b>[3] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990.<b> That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding,<b> but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes[4] from 1990 he listed[5]<b> "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first. <b>

                    The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first<b> mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.<b>[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. <b>Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an <b>in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN.<b> Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[8] <b>
                    
                    HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and <b>other material into visual or audible web pages.<b> Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics<b> can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS.<b> Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML,<b> which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF<b> command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) <b>operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually <b>format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements <b>(nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure <b>band markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS
